Solving the Dirac Hamiltonian for Many Electron Atoms using the Dirac Hartree Fock Self Consistent Field Method in MATLAB

Wrote the complete MATLAB code to perform the SCF Procedure to solve the Dirac Hamiltonian for Many Electron Atoms. Familiarity with Fortran was also required as the old limited code was in Fortran.
